1. Overall experience : Quite chaotic when we are working on one pager since we
   aren't that sure for the API requests.
2. Project : our project is a webpage for
   budget list or cashflow notes.
3. We are communicating with each other, made a
   Whatsapp group and then made one pager together.
4. Hopefully i can make
   something useful for someone else.

Our team's goal for today is completing main interface, GET and POST API. I made
API for server side in app.py with flask frameworks. It is still incomplete for
now. I think i just do average stuff in programming side, i think i did well for
communicating in dividing job, keep the group talking to each other. Other
member has better skills in programming like flawless interface and POST API.
Without much hassle, their code easily integrate with mine. However my code has
some problem with undefined variable, missing bracket, letter and many more. Our
team's next goal is updating feature and fixing delete.

"Our team's made a good progress today, fixing some small problems, add update
feature but it is still incomplete, user interface, modal for update, and many
more. I made that total balance, total income and total expense. Delete API, and
fixing the date. I learned about ternary operator. Like when people need to
append multiple lines of code, they can add if logic inside that code string
with ternary. I think i did great for presentation. Not really anxious and i
think i deliver the information clearly. We still haven't done with login
system, make an user account, verify the user. Also Mr. Adhit give us a good
suggestion. We can add goals system. Where the user add a new goal and
notification if the balance is higher than that goals. I forgot to take a
screenshot so it is just a screenshot after the presentation is over. "

Week 1 is just finished, but we still have more stuff to learn in the future.
This programs from Sparta Coding Club is really amazing. Even i thought
pre-course alone is already good enough and give me lot of knowledge. Together
with Learning X and organized LXI-Sparta Bootcamp. Through this bootcamp lot of
Indonesians college students or fresh graduate can learn about Coding and become
Full-stack developer. From my team mate, i learned about lot of stuff. All of
them are much better than me in programming. Like testing code in front end and
testing code in back end. Also how to use css properly with flexbox and
responsive ui, security issue with onclick. It is better to put the click code
in javascript.
