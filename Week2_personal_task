📌 **Requirements**

</aside>

- You can change design like color but please keep the layout the same.

1. When you type your to-do in the input box of ‘title’ and ‘content’, and click the ADD button, there’s a new to-do added in Working.. and the input boxes get empty.
   - Example (in Korean)
     [화면 기록 2022-06-27 오후 8.16.44.mov](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/b6c4b646-58d7-43ee-b942-15046363cb1c/화면_기록_2022-06-27_오후_8.16.44.mov)
2. Conditional rendering : When isDone status of to-do is true, make the text of the button ‘Cancel’. When isDone status of to-do is false, then make the text of the button ‘Done’.
3. When the status of to-do is `Working`, place it in the upper section. When the status of to-do is `Done,`place it in the lower section
   - Example (in Korean)
     [화면 기록 2022-06-27 오후 8.20.14.mov](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a7d5a8f8-6e73-41e3-a7c8-0f83e2cdb16e/화면_기록_2022-06-27_오후_8.20.14.mov)
