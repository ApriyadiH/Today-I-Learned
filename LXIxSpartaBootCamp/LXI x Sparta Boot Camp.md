1. Overall experience : Quite chaotic when we are working on one pager since we
   aren't that sure for the API requests.
2. Project : our project is a webpage for
   budget list or cashflow notes.
3. We are communicating with each other, made a
   Whatsapp group and then made one pager together.
4. Hopefully i can make
   something useful for someone else.

Our team's goal for today is completing main interface, GET and POST API. I made
API for server side in app.py with flask frameworks. It is still incomplete for
now. I think i just do average stuff in programming side, i think i did well for
communicating in dividing job, keep the group talking to each other. Other
member has better skills in programming like flawless interface and POST API.
Without much hassle, their code easily integrate with mine. However my code has
some problem with undefined variable, missing bracket, letter and many more. Our
team's next goal is updating feature and fixing delete.

"Our team's made a good progress today, fixing some small problems, add update
feature but it is still incomplete, user interface, modal for update, and many
more. I made that total balance, total income and total expense. Delete API, and
fixing the date. I learned about ternary operator. Like when people need to
append multiple lines of code, they can add if logic inside that code string
with ternary. I think i did great for presentation. Not really anxious and i
think i deliver the information clearly. We still haven't done with login
system, make an user account, verify the user. Also Mr. Adhit give us a good
suggestion. We can add goals system. Where the user add a new goal and
notification if the balance is higher than that goals. I forgot to take a
screenshot so it is just a screenshot after the presentation is over. "

Week 1 is just finished, but we still have more stuff to learn in the future.
This programs from Sparta Coding Club is really amazing. Even i thought
pre-course alone is already good enough and give me lot of knowledge. Together
with Learning X and organized LXI-Sparta Bootcamp. Through this bootcamp lot of
Indonesians college students or fresh graduate can learn about Coding and become
Full-stack developer. From my team mate, i learned about lot of stuff. All of
them are much better than me in programming. Like testing code in front end and
testing code in back end. Also how to use css properly with flexbox and
responsive ui, security issue with onclick. It is better to put the click code
in javascript.

Today we are adding some small features. adding alert and confirm buttton. Alert if one of the input field is empty and confirm if the delete button is pressed. Confirm somehow works normally. But alert will reload the page. Later we can add (event).preventDefault. Not sure how it works but somehow it can stop reloading page after pressing a button.

I'm not doing well today.

Everything went well so far, until i must deploy the app to heroku. I never done it before. So changing package.json, npm and yarn has conflicting lock file. But the most frustating part is when i try to access wrong link. The link with .git at the end from heroku isn't the application. The actual link is on the top. I thought i have an error and tried to retry the whole step from the eginning and wasting more time. For now i already knew what to do, to deploy the code with heroku and react.

Image above, me after finished with mini task. I'm sure i tried my best, but in the end it doesn't end that well.

State is a value inside of a component that you can change with several event or action. Like when the user click a button, when the user input a letter to the input field.

Props is whatever the value you transfer from Parent to a Child.

JavaScript will re-render the interface whenever the State change or when props is transferred.

Today we are learning about basic javascript. Data type, mathematical operator, logic operator, looping. Basic stuff and more details on catatan_js.js

Sunday stil learning and studying the video lecture. For short summary, redux will allow the programmer keep some state in a separated file where other component can access it without transferring it from Parent to Children.

We are working on team task, learning the theory part. How redux works, how to store the data after refresh, optional chaining, and button type and its effect for redux. Button have several type and it may refresh the page and re-initialize redux data. At some point we need to refresh, redux can store its data with sessions or local storage and many other way.

i don't think i have huge improvement today. Just doing personal task. The pace is quite slow and i kept reviewing lecture notes several times. I also move several folder on github repository. I think it is good for now.

Today i'm not doing that well.

I need to improve my basic knowledge with redux. 

I always put 1 image each day, Actually forgot to take better screenshot. But the image from last sessions when we are done with sharing team task DIY questions on Zoom.

Today I'm working on personal task. I have good progress today and manage to finsihed the task with help from mentoring. Later when i tried to deploy it, i have some issue with the url. Somehow github behave weirdly with router. So i need to change BrowserRouter to HashRouter. I'm not really sure what is the difference except it use "#" or not but it works better with HashRouter.

I think nothing is really good but just okay. Not much innovative part from this personal task and all of it seems average.

I need to improve my knowledge about deploying react app. Like what each new code line actually do. After trial and error, i think i can deploy new app without thinking too much.

The image from last part around 11 pm. We are supposed to share our TIL with Zoom but cancelled because several people still haven't submit their personal tasks. Actually i'm one of them. I thought the deadline is later and i still have time to deploy my app on github. In the end i just submit it without deploying. After the deadline i asked mentor and the problem solved. App deployed succesfully. Really amazing.

Week 3 just end. Last day ended with exam. I think i'm doing well since i finished 1 hr earlier. But for last question i'm not really sure why normal function will cause an error but arrow function works fine. Really weird

For this week, i learned lot of new stuff like styling with styled components, best practice for react js folder structure, duck pattern, redux. Redux use lot of new term like action, create action, reducer, payload, dispatch, selector. Really hard for me and those terms sounds like random word put together. But now it sounds reasonable. I saw the animation, team task covered it a little bit. But i didn't understand at that time.  

i didn't add lot of new stuff in catatan_react.md for now. I will fixed it later. 

Miss Eunseo said people in Sparta Coding Club will read this TIL. Am i allowed to write my notes with Indonesian Language ? Also hi. 아녕하세요. Before boot camp i learned korean every day. But for last 2 days i didn't. Maybe i spent too much time for this bootcamp. I'm sorry I will not add this part in the future since this is supposed to be programming TIL. Thank you for reading. 

i took the image after i finished the test.

Sunday is supposed to be free day or learning more lecture nots. But on afternoon we are discussing our team task project on ZEP. Discussing about older wireframe, some project scope so it isn't really hard and feasible within 3 days. Spread the job. I'm working on the logic or CRUD API.
2 images from when we started and we finished.

Today we are working on team task theory and project. The theory is relatively easy. Then explain the answer to other team member. After that we are working on team task project. Most UI are already done. Other team Yudhit is really amazing. I just convert the existing code to Toolkit Redux version so we can use the devkit. Also working on how to convert a text on images. Later i need to learn how to stack multiple image and convert it to one image.

We also discussing past exam answer. More or less i think i answered correctly. 

I forgot to take the screenshot from zoom session and ZEP, so i use UI image for this week project. Hopefully i have enough time.

Still working on team task... it is really hard and i'm totally not focused on the essential requirement, but i'm done with stacking images. Lot of issues like wrapping text. It is still looks good i can make custom image with combining several images and some text. Also All of those are converted to image. 

Image for user interface and some result.

I made that meme card with our app. Honestly it feels good to work on that image. Converting text to image is quite hard and totally new for me. But missing lot of essentials requirements. I still need to learn how to combine axios, thunk and json server. Somehow i hope video lectures teach us about those stuff directly instead of teaching the basic concept.

Today is the exam, theory test, relatively hard. At least i manage to answer almost all of the questions except for number 3. Code question is hard and i need to test it and make sure the code works. 

Learn lof of new terms today. 
High order component basically like adopting a parent or wrapping existing code with extra layer.
reconciliation, one of the video give a nice explaination. Basically react only render specific change to increase the performance.
Flux and MVC algorithm isn't a new knowledge for me. But i have no idea for a good application with MVC in react.
Other library for managing state, we just learned redux, there are more like Zustand, MobX. Also while i searched about these stuff, i also see easypeasy. The article said it combine both of redux and zustand good side. Maybe it is better ? but for now Redux is more popular, which mean more documentation and error case in stackoverflow or other sites.

Image from near last sessions where we are playing mini game like Zombie, bomb and painting floor.

Start with reviewing old exam questions. I think i made lot of mistakes and missing lot of important points. But it is clear now after we discuss the answer with Mentor Justin. After that some short review for our weekly project. This week we should clone coding other sites. We choose yugioh card maker, similar project like before but hopefully we can fix more feature and add more.

Image for all available state in the card. I need to learn about react lazy or anything related to splitting code.
