1. Overall experience : Quite chaotic when we are working on one pager since we
   aren't that sure for the API requests.
2. Project : our project is a webpage for
   budget list or cashflow notes.
3. We are communicating with each other, made a
   Whatsapp group and then made one pager together.
4. Hopefully i can make
   something useful for someone else.

Our team's goal for today is completing main interface, GET and POST API. I made
API for server side in app.py with flask frameworks. It is still incomplete for
now. I think i just do average stuff in programming side, i think i did well for
communicating in dividing job, keep the group talking to each other. Other
member has better skills in programming like flawless interface and POST API.
Without much hassle, their code easily integrate with mine. However my code has
some problem with undefined variable, missing bracket, letter and many more. Our
team's next goal is updating feature and fixing delete.

"Our team's made a good progress today, fixing some small problems, add update
feature but it is still incomplete, user interface, modal for update, and many
more. I made that total balance, total income and total expense. Delete API, and
fixing the date. I learned about ternary operator. Like when people need to
append multiple lines of code, they can add if logic inside that code string
with ternary. I think i did great for presentation. Not really anxious and i
think i deliver the information clearly. We still haven't done with login
system, make an user account, verify the user. Also Mr. Adhit give us a good
suggestion. We can add goals system. Where the user add a new goal and
notification if the balance is higher than that goals. I forgot to take a
screenshot so it is just a screenshot after the presentation is over. "

Week 1 is just finished, but we still have more stuff to learn in the future.
This programs from Sparta Coding Club is really amazing. Even i thought
pre-course alone is already good enough and give me lot of knowledge. Together
with Learning X and organized LXI-Sparta Bootcamp. Through this bootcamp lot of
Indonesians college students or fresh graduate can learn about Coding and become
Full-stack developer. From my team mate, i learned about lot of stuff. All of
them are much better than me in programming. Like testing code in front end and
testing code in back end. Also how to use css properly with flexbox and
responsive ui, security issue with onclick. It is better to put the click code
in javascript.

Today we are adding some small features. adding alert and confirm buttton. Alert if one of the input field is empty and confirm if the delete button is pressed. Confirm somehow works normally. But alert will reload the page. Later we can add (event).preventDefault. Not sure how it works but somehow it can stop reloading page after pressing a button.

I'm not doing well today.

Everything went well so far, until i must deploy the app to heroku. I never done it before. So changing package.json, npm and yarn has conflicting lock file. But the most frustating part is when i try to access wrong link. The link with .git at the end from heroku isn't the application. The actual link is on the top. I thought i have an error and tried to retry the whole step from the eginning and wasting more time. For now i already knew what to do, to deploy the code with heroku and react.

Image above, me after finished with mini task. I'm sure i tried my best, but in the end it doesn't end that well.

State is a value inside of a component that you can change with several event or action. Like when the user click a button, when the user input a letter to the input field.

Props is whatever the value you transfer from Parent to a Child.

JavaScript will re-render the interface whenever the State change or when props is transferred.

Today we are learning about basic javascript. Data type, mathematical operator, logic operator, looping. Basic stuff and more details on catatan_js.js

Sunday stil learning and studying the video lecture. For short summary, redux will allow the programmer keep some state in a separated file where other component can access it without transferring it from Parent to Children.

We are working on team task, learning the theory part. How redux works, how to store the data after refresh, optional chaining, and button type and its effect for redux. Button have several type and it may refresh the page and re-initialize redux data. At some point we need to refresh, redux can store its data with sessions or local storage and many other way.

i don't think i have huge improvement today. Just doing personal task. The pace is quite slow and i kept reviewing lecture notes several times. I also move several folder on github repository. I think it is good for now.

Today i'm not doing that well.

I need to improve my basic knowledge with redux. 

I always put 1 image each day, Actually forgot to take better screenshot. But the image from last sessions when we are done with sharing team task DIY questions on Zoom.

Today I'm working on personal task. I have good progress today and manage to finsihed the task with help from mentoring. Later when i tried to deploy it, i have some issue with the url. Somehow github behave weirdly with router. So i need to change BrowserRouter to HashRouter. I'm not really sure what is the difference except it use "#" or not but it works better with HashRouter.

I think nothing is really good but just okay. Not much innovative part from this personal task and all of it seems average.

I need to improve my knowledge about deploying react app. Like what each new code line actually do. After trial and error, i think i can deploy new app without thinking too much.

The image from last part around 11 pm. We are supposed to share our TIL with Zoom but cancelled because several people still haven't submit their personal tasks. Actually i'm one of them. I thought the deadline is later and i still have time to deploy my app on github. In the end i just submit it without deploying. After the deadline i asked mentor and the problem solved. App deployed succesfully. Really amazing.
