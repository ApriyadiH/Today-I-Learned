what is **one-way data flow?**

- State describes the condition of the app at a specific point in time
- The UI is rendered based on that state
- When something happens (such as a user clicking a button), the state is updated based on what occurred
- The UI re-renders based on the new state

However, the simplicity can break down when we haveÂ **multiple components that need to share and use the same state**, especially if those components are located in different parts of the application. Sometimes this can be solved byÂ ["lifting state up"](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html)Â to parent components, but that doesn't always help.

One way to solve this is to extract the shared state from the components, and put it into a centralized location outside the component tree. With this, our component tree becomes a big "view", and any component can access the state or trigger actions, no matter where they are in the tree!

By defining and separating the concepts involved in state management and enforcing rules that maintain independence between views and states, we give our code more structure and maintainability.

This is the basic idea behind Redux: a single centralized place to contain the global state in your application, and specific patterns to follow when updating that state to make the code predictable.

What is reducer function?

AÂ **reducer**
Â is a function that receives the currentÂ `state`
Â and anÂ `action`
Â object, decides how to update the state if necessary, and returns the new state:Â `(state, action) => newState`
.Â **You can think of a reducer as an event listener which handles events based on the received action (event) type.**

Reducers mustÂ *always*Â follow some specific rules:

- They should only calculate the new state value based on theÂ `state`Â andÂ `action`Â arguments
- They are not allowed to modify the existingÂ `state`. Instead, they must makeÂ *immutable updates*, by copying the existingÂ `state`Â and making changes to the copied values.
- They must not do any asynchronous logic, calculate random values, or cause other "side effects"

We'll talk more about the rules of reducers later, including why they're important and how to follow them correctly.

The logic inside reducer functions typically follows the same series of steps:

- Check to see if the reducer cares about this action
    - If so, make a copy of the state, update the copy with new values, and return it
- Otherwise, return the existing state unchanged
